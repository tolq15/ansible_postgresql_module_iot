For 'postgresql' module
=======================
1. Add config settings for repmgr.
2. Add 'shared' settings for extentions when needed.
3. Add additional parameters for extensions (pg_stat_statements).
4. Remove pgtune and monit. Looks like they are not in use any more.
5. Looks like pgsql_profile and pgtab can be removed.
   They are for yum installation only and not in use.
   Also, postgresql_service_user_pgsql_profile is 'false' by default.
6. Check if it possible to create links between /etc/postgres/.../... configuration files
   and /var/lib/postgresql/.../.../ files.
